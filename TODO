Compiler Design

> Scanner :
        Read input file
        Send to token factory

> Make tokens :
        Take strings
        Validate
        Make tokens
        Return tokens to Parser

> Parser :
        Take tokens in sequence and build parse tree
        Tree can have sub-tree as its child

> Evaluate :
        Tree should be able to evaluate tokens

> conversion :
        Tree will be able to convert token expression in other language
